Stripe.com Wordpress Plugin
=================================================================================================

I converted @joeynelson's code here https://github.com/wlrs/stripe-terminal to a Wordpress plugin. The plugin allows you to easily add http://stripe.com payment services to your Wordpress site and begin accepting credit cards.

Getting Started
----------------------
To get started do the following:

1. Pull down the code from Github.
2. Create a 'stripe-plugin' folder under your Wordpress plugins folder.
3. Upload the code to the new folder.
4. Activate the plugin.
5. Configure the plugin via the Admin panel
6. Use the short code (instructions on the Admin panel) to add a payment form
